# University Student System Migration

## Overview

This project simulates a part of the student management system used by a university. The system is responsible for handling student data, including student ID, first name, last name, email, age, days to complete each course, and degree program. The program reads and processes this student data using C++ and provides several functions for managing and manipulating the data.

## Purpose

You were hired as a contractor to migrate an existing student system to a new platform using C++. The system will use two classes: **Student** and **Roster**, which will work together to manage the student data.

## Requirements
